This attack-analysis project explores the landscape of cybersecurity by examining how an attack vector can relate to mitreâ€™s Common Weakness Enumerations (CWEs). A file of attack vectors is compared to each of the 11 tactics from attack.mitre.org. For each attack, the tactics are ranked based on how similar they are to the attack vector using one of three ranking systems: Jaccard Similarity Index, weighted zeros, or percent of techniques used (as defined in rationale.txt). Dependencies between tactics are represented in a dependency graph, and mappings from tactics to technical impacts from CWEs are represented in an association graph using the JGraphT library. The program traverses the dependency and association graphs from the highest ranked tactic to determine which technical impacts are most at risk of being exploited by this tactic. Each technical impact has several CWEs associated with it; thus, an attack vector can be analyzed to determine which CWEs are most vulnerable to a given attack.

In order to run the project, the file of tactics, file of attack vectors to analyze, and [optional] ranking method should be supplied as arguments respectively. The tactics and attack files should be in csv format. The ranking method should be one of jsi, weighted, techniques, or all. For instance, the following command could be used on the command-line: java AttackAnalysis tactics.csv attackmectors.csv jsi. The ranking of tactics and CWE breakdown for each attack is written to a file in the attack-analysis directory.
